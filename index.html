        <h1>My profile</h1>
        
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p>Name: Sholom Serebryanski</p>
        <p>Student number/email: s3865263@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
        <p>Nationality: Australian</p>
        <P>Education to date: I went through school in Melbourne then did a year of rabbinical studies in England and 3 years in America.</P>
        <p>Languages spoken: English is my first language but also speak a lot of Hebrew and Yiddish.</p>
        <p>Interesting fact: I am a tri-citizen with Australian, English and American citizenships.</p>
        
        <h3>Interest in it</h3>
        <h5>What? When? Why? and experience </h5>
        <p>My interest in IT is mainly in programming. My interests in programming started when my brother who is a programmer was studying for an interview and asked me to help. I always really enjoyed solving logic problems and while helping to study for his interviews I realized how logic based programming is and it went from there. Currently I have almost no actual it experience outside of normal computer and phone usage.   
        </p>
        <h5>Why RMIT?</h5>
        <p>I was looking for a course connected to programming and after looking around I found the easiest way to do a course was though OUA. After going through the courses OUA offers the bachelors of IT from RMIT was the only one that made sense.</p>
        <h5>Expectations</h5>
        <p>Through the course of my studies I expect to learn what tools are used in the world of IT and how to use them.</p>
        
    
        <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
       
        <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50020375?type=standard#searchRequestToken=8dab1b05-7627-4045-aac3-7f541a414128">link</a>
        
        <img src="dream%20job.png" width="800">
        
        <p>What’s required: The requirements for the job are a bachelor’s in computer science related topic, experience with a number of different programing languages, strong background in latest technologies and good communication skills.</p>
        <p>Why ideal: This job is ideal because it is in Melbourne where I want to live, it has continuous training so I can continue to grow, it is flexible work hours, it is in the area that I want to work in and it has a solid salary.</p>
        <p>What’s required: The requirements for the job are a bachelor’s in computer science related topic, experience with a number of different programing languages, strong background in latest technologies and good communication skills.</p>
        <p>Current: Currently I have virtually no experience, I don’t yet have the degree, my communication skills could use some work and I don’t have the best technical background.</p>
        <p>How: I plan on getting the degree now, then probably a coding boot camp to learn more intense coding and get a job in the industry to get the required experience.</p>
        <h3>Personality tests</h3>
        <p>Myers-Briggs - INTJ (introverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging)</p>
        <p>Learning style test – tactile</p>
        <p>DiSC assessment test - steadiness - 40%, compliance - 36%, dominance - 18% and
        influence - 7%
        </p>
        <h5>What these results mean to me.</h5>
        <p>These test results mean very little to me for a few reasons. The first reason these tests mean little to me is that they don’t tell me anything I didn’t already know about myself. The second reason is because I don’t trust the accuracy of these test for example I took the Myers-Briggs test a few times on different websites to see what would happen and although I answered honestly every time I got different results (I posted the one I think is most like me). </p>
        <h5>How these results will affect how i work in a team.</h5>
        <p>I don’t think these test results will affect how I work in a team for a couple of reasons. The reason I don’t think it will affect how I work in a team is because they mean very little to me.</p>
        <h5>How this should be taken into account when forming teams.</h5>
        <p>I think the actual test results shouldn’t be taken into account when forming teams for the reasons that I previously explained. However people having different personalities should be taken into account because for example if there is no one who will get the talking going then you are not going to get anywhere, or sometimes you need someone who is more creative, or someone willing to just sit and think out a problem.</p>
        
        <h3>IT Project</h3>
        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>My idea for an IT project is a to create a streaming platform or an addition to a pre-existing platform that is more friendly for the viewers than the ones already out there like twitch, Facebook, you tube and others. The platform will be more friendly by allowing more viewer interaction and give more choices to the viewer as opposed to the streamer.</p>
        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>My motivation for making such a platform is my experiences watching streamers on the existing platforms. For example, a lot of the time when I watch dotA 2 on twitch there are often arguments where the streamer should put their face cam or which statistics, like biggest donors or subscribers to show on the screen. My idea is to make a platform that allows the viewer to make these decisions in order to give everyone the best viewing experience possible.</p>
        <h5>description</h5>
        <p>The streaming platform will allow people to stream whatever they want whist giving the viewers the ability to make more decisions. Amongst the decisions that viewers will be able to make, firstly there will be the ability to move location and change size of the streamers face cam in order that they could choose which parts of the gameplay or whatever is being streamed they don’t mind being blocked or even putting it over part of the chat or off to the side. Another choice to give the viewers is where to put things like the subscriber stats or donation stats that often also usually block part of the screen. The issue with this is that often streamers want their viewers to see things in order to persuade the viewers to do thing, for example they show the donation stats to convince you to donate, so therefore the streamers will be able to choose things you have to have somewhere on the screen. For example, the streamer can choose that you must display the top 3 subscriber stats or put a minimum size on their face camera and other things like that.</p>
        
        
        
        <h5>Outcome</h5>
        <p>If the project is successful it will solve the issues by allowing the viewer to make the choices so that there will no longer be any complaints while at the same time giving the streamer some choices to make sure that they don’t lose out so everyone ends up happy.</p>
