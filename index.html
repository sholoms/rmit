        <h1>My profile</h1>
        
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p>Name: Sholom Serebryanski</p>
        <p>Student number/email: s3865263@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
        <p>Nationality: Australian</p>
        <P>Education to date: I went through school in Melbourne then did a year of rabbinical studies in England and 3 years in America.</P>
        <p>Languages spoken: English is my first language but also speak a lot of Hebrew and Yiddish.</p>
        <p>Interesting fact: I am a tri-citizen with Australian, English and American citizenships.</p>
        
        <h3>Interest in it</h3>
        <h5>What? When? Why? and experience </h5>
        <p>My interest in IT is mainly in programming. My interests in programming started when my brother who is a programmer was studying for an interview and asked me to help. I always really enjoyed solving logic problems and while helping to study for his interviews I realized how logic based programming is and it went from there. Currently I have almost no actual it experience outside of normal computer and phone usage.   
        </p>
        <h5>Why RMIT?</h5>
        <p>I was looking for a course connected to programming and after looking around I found the easiest way to do a course was though OUA. After going through the courses OUA offers the bachelors of IT from RMIT was the only one that made sense.</p>
        <h5>Expectations</h5>
        <p>Through the course of my studies I expect to learn how to program and how the world of IT works.</p>
        
    
        <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
       
        <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50020375?type=standard#searchRequestToken=8dab1b05-7627-4045-aac3-7f541a414128">link</a>
        
        <img src="dream%20job.png" width="800">
        
        <p>What’s required: The requirements for the job are a bachelor’s in computer science related topic, experience with a number of different programing languages, strong background in latest technologies and good communication skills.</p>
        <p>Why ideal: This job is ideal because it is in Melbourne where I want to live, it has continuous training so I can continue to grow, it is flexible work hours, it is in the area that I want to work in and it has a solid salary.</p>
        <p>What’s required: The requirements for the job are a bachelor’s in computer science related topic, experience with a number of different programing languages, strong background in latest technologies and good communication skills.</p>
        <p>Current: Currently I have virtually no experience, I don’t yet have the degree, my communication skills could use some work and I don’t have the best technical background.</p>
        <p>How: I plan on getting the degree now, then probably a coding boot camp to learn more intense coding and get a job in the industry to get the required experience.</p>
        <h3>Personality tests</h3>
        <p>Myers-Briggs - INTJ (introverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging)</p>
        <p>Learning style test – tactile</p>
        <p>DiSC assessment test - steadiness - 40%, compliance - 36%, dominance - 18% and
        influence - 7%
        </p>
        <h5>What these results mean to me.</h5>
        <p>These test results mean very little to me for a few reasons. The first reason these tests mean little to me is that they don’t tell me anything I didn’t already know about myself. The second reason is because I don’t trust the accuracy of these test for example I took the Myers-Briggs test a few times on different websites to see what would happen and although I answered honestly every time I got different results (I posted the one I think is most like me). </p>
        <h5>How these results will affect how i work in a team.</h5>
        <p>I don’t think these test results will affect how I work in a team for a couple of reasons. The reason I don’t think it will affect how I work in a team is because they mean very little to me.</p>
        <h5>How this should be taken into account when forming teams.</h5>
        <p>I think the actual test results shouldn’t be taken into account when forming teams for the reasons that I previously explained. However people having different personalities should be taken into account because for example if there is no one who will get the talking going then you are not going to get anywhere, or sometimes you need someone who is more creative, or someone willing to just sit and think out a problem.</p>
